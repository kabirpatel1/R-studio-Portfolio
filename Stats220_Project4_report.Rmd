## Introduction
For project 4 I chose the Sidemen youtube channel and the Koa Rothman Youtube channel. This is becuase the difference in views and likes in these channels are drastically different but I wanted to see more about the like to view ratio. 

One idea I had before hand was to see if the length of the video titles had any correlation to it's like/view ratio. Another idea I had was to see the differece in like/view ratio between the videos and how many different videos would fit in the different categories. 

For plot 1 I decided to focus on the like/view ratio varible that I created and the the catergories varible that I also created. I thought the easiest way to show this clearly would be a bar graph geom_bar where you can see the average like view ratio for each categorys. 

For plot 2 I decided to focus on the title length varible with the like/ view varibale and thought to best way to showcase this would be on a scatter plot using geom_point. 

For plot 3 I used the ratio category with the mean view and used geom_boxplot to showcase a box and whisker for each of the categorys showing the range of them. I tried experimenting with a scatter with this but thought a box plot would be better. 


## Dynamic data story

This shows some aspect of creativity as I used a grey and white color theme throughout which matches my report theme. I also used a times new roman font to make the text look more professional. I thought the use of three different graphical visualizations also showed creativity.
